# simple-shell
Simple shell program with window commands that works in linux environment. This codes were written to enhance my understandings on the operating systems.

## installation
1. Download SimpleShell_KimKijung.c file.
2. Compile and run from Fedora or other Linux environment

## Usage
You can run most Linux commands at /bin directory with this shell program. Moreover, I have added exit and cd commands as in-built commands for this shell program, since I was not able to use cd command at /bin and users may want to turn off the program at some time. Since I have created this file as an assignment for the OS lecture, I hope the source code may be helpful to other students at certain moment. Thank you!
